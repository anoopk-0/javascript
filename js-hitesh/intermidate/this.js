/*
Functions, in JavaScript, are essentially objects. Like objects they can be assigned to variables, passed to other functions and returned from functions. And much like objects, they have their own properties. One of these properties is this.
The value that this stores is the current execution context of the JavaScript program.Thus, when used inside a function thisâ€˜s value will change depending on how that function is defined, how it is invoked and the default execution context.
