/*
A function expression can be stored in a variable:
var x = function (a, b) {return a * b};

A declared function is “saved for later use”, and will be executed later, when it is invoked (called).
function(){}

**Function declarations load before any code is executed while Function expressions load only when the interpreter reaches that line of code**

Function declarations are hoisted but function expressions are not.
